# Discord-Python-Connect-4
Hello and welcome to my discord connect 4 bot, inspiration for this game was taken by the original board game. The aim for this project was to take the original board game game put it into discord servers
so that everyone can enjoy it while they're being social in different servers. 
To start a game type "$connect4 @Discord_Name" and the game will start with you going first.

React to the numbers to place one of your counters in the associate column of that counter, e.g choosing "1" will place your counter in the 1st column to the left.

Upon reacting, the bot will delete the image and repost it so it doesn't clutter text chats with the placement of the counter as shown above.
